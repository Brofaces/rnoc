rnoc
====

RNOC is a Network Operations Center built with Ruby on Rails.

What can I do?
==============

* Create pages which can contain images (generated by your favorite monitoring tools) or an iframe (gasp) of another web page!
* Cycle through different pages! (For your 50 inch office TV)
* Disable pages which aren't relevant!
* Be the most professional nerd in your IT organization!
* Configure logo in `config/rnoc.yml`: **logo**
* Configure site title in `config/rnoc.yml`: **site_title**


It's RESTFUL
============
Use the [REST API](/API.md) to create/delete pages and pageboxes.

How do I get started
====================

Install the necessary gems
--------------------------

1. You might need some `-devel` libraries for this to compile native
gem extensions. In particular, `mysql-devel`, and `sqlite-devel`:

    $ bundle install

2. Initialize the database. No configs to edit if you're using sqlite:

    $ rake db:migrate

3. Start it up!

    $ bundle exec thin start
